		  	Client shall indemnify, defend and save Manager harmless from all liability, claims and suits arising out of the duties lawfully performed by the Manager under this agreement
				other than those arising because of willful negligence or an intentional tort by Manager or its employees. Client agrees to defend and save Manager harmless for the assessment
				of any late fees resulting from charges which could not be paid timely because Client failed to maintain a sufficient balance in the Client’s operating account after notice by
				the Manager. Furthermore, Client shall indemnify and hold Manager, its employees, agents, officers and directors (“Indemnitees”) harmless from all damage, loss, cost or attorney’s
				fees Indemnitees may sustain on account of: (1) any damage to or destruction of any property by guests, any third party, or any terrorism, acts of nature, or acts of God; (2) any
				injury to or death of any person from any cause whatsoever; (3) any error of judgment by Indemnitees or any mistake of law or fact by Indemnitees; and (4) to the extent not covered
				by insurance, any alleged violation of any law (statutory, common or otherwise) pertaining to the actions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to
				environmental protection, rent control, taxes, fair housing, or any other such laws. This indemnity provision applies if the claim arises out of the sole negligence of Manager.
				However, it shall not apply if it is finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction that an officer, agent, director or employee of Manager acted with gross negligence
				 or willful misconduct.

	<h2>Booking and Cancellation</h2>
	<div class="legal_section">
		<ol>
			<li>The Booking Summary which you have accepted is
		      not a booking confirmation. The Accommodation will be booked for the Booking
		      Period set forth in the Booking Summary (the "Booking Period") upon your
		      receipt of a Confirmation of Booking and the Host is not obliged to make the
		      Accommodation available, nor is a binding contract in place, until such time as
		      the Confirmation of Booking has been sent to you by email.
			</li>
		  <li>Pursuant to your Agreement with your Reservations Supplier, you have authorized your Reservations Supplier to
		      collect and remit various fees and charges that will be due and owing by you in
		      connection with your use of the Club, its Authorized Suppliers and the
		      Accommodation, including, without limitation, the prepayment amount as set out
		      in the Booking Summary, Accommodation Fees, and all fees, charges and taxes
		      payable with respect to your booking of the Accommodation and use of services
		      provided by Authorized Suppliers. Upon receipt by you of the Confirmation of
		      Booking, you will immediately be required to pay, and your Reservation Supplier
		      will charge the debit or credit card that you have supplied, an amount equal to
		      the prepayment amount required to be paid on confirmation of booking as shall
		      be set out in the Booking Summary (which may be the entire amount of the fees
		      due including all amounts due to any Authorized Supplier and all taxes or other
		      fees dues with respect to your Booking).
			</li>
		  <li>Unless otherwise specified in the Confirmation
		      of Booking the following cancellation policy will apply. If you cancel a
		      booking within 24 hours of your receipt of a Confirmation of Booking, provided
		      you book more than seven days prior to your stay, then you are entitled to a
		      full refund. If you cancel a booking more than 14 days prior to commencement of
		      the Booking Period then you will be responsible for 50% of the full
		      accommodation fees as set out in the Confirmation of Booking ("Accommodation
		      Fees") for the entirety of the Booking Period and your Reservations Supplier
		      will charge such sums to the credit or debit card which you supplied when
		      making the booking.
			</li>
		  <li>If you cancel a booking 14 days or less prior to the commencement of the Booking Period then you will be responsible for the
		      full Accommodation Fees for the entirety of the Booking Period and your Reservations Supplier will charge such sums to the credit or debit card which
		      you supplied when making the booking.
			</li>
		  <li>Host is not entitled to cancel a booking once a
		      Confirmation of Booking has been sent. However there may be circumstances
		      beyond the reasonable control of Host or emergency situations in which the
		      Accommodation is unavailable for all or part of a Booking Period. In those
		      circumstances you may contact the Club to see if they can assist, however Host
		      is solely responsible for arranging for suitable alternative accommodations
		      during the Booking Period (which will, if possible, be of comparable quality
		      and character and may be a 4 star hotel within 2 miles of the location of the
		      Accommodation). In the event the Club is unable to assist in finding suitable
		      alternative accommodations during the BookingPeriod, the Club will cause the
		      Reservations Supplier to credit you with the full refund. The Club shall have
		      no responsibility or liability as a result of a cancellation of a booking,
		      however, if alternative hosted accommodation is available through another
		      member of the Club then your contract with the Host may be terminated and your
		      Reservations Supplier will arrange for a new agreement entered into with a new
		      Host.
			</li>
		  <li>Host agrees with you that notwithstanding the
		      provisions of the terms set out above that in the event that you cancel a
		      booking due to exceptional circumstances beyond your reasonable control and the
		      Club (at its discretion) recommends that you receive a full or partial refund
		      then the Host will honor such recommendation.
			</li>
		  <li>It is a condition of a booking made through the
		      Club that all of the Club Rules (including in relation to the appointment of
		      Authorized Suppliers) are complied with in full by both parties. Any failure by
		      either you or Host to comply with Club Rules including any failure to allow
		      Authorized Suppliers to supply services will permit the other party to
		      terminate this Agreement without liability (and without prejudice to any other
		      rights and remedies pursuant to this Agreement).
			</li>
		  <li>Host agrees with you that in the event that you
		      cancel a booking due to any failure on the part of the Host to comply with the
		      Club Rules and standards or to engage appropriate Authorized Suppliers or due
		      to the mis-description of the Accommodation or other act or omission of Host
		      and if the Club (at its discretion) recommends that you receive a full or
		      partial refund then the Host will honor such recommendation (without prejudice
		      to any other rights you may have under this agreement).
			</li>
		  <li>In the event that the Accommodation becomes
		      unavailable for the whole or any part of the Booking Period and you do not
		      accept a suitable alternative accommodation which is offered to you, then you
		      are entitled to cancel the booking, and the pre-payment will be refunded to
		      you, but neither the Host nor the Club nor any of the Club&rsquo;s Authorized
		      Suppliers will be liable to you for any further amounts in respect of the
